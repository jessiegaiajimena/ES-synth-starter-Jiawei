1.	Menu: Pressing on knob 1 will open the menu page.
2.	Wave: Seven types of acoustic signals can be selected as the waveform: sawtooth, sine, square, triangle, saxophone, piano, and bell. The waveform type can be adjusted by rotating knob 2.
3.	Tone: The tone feature sets the notes on the master board to a specific octave, and all other slave boards will adjust their octaves according to the master board. Adjusting the tone is realized through clockwise rotation of knob 3.
4.	Volume: The volume can be changed by rotating knob 4 clockwise, with volume 1 being the lowest volume level and volume 8 being the highest.
   
Menu page

Once on the menu page, move the joystick sideways to navigate between different features and select on a specific feature by pressing the joystick. For all features, there is a state parameter controlled by knob 2, pressing on which sets the state parameter to ‘on’ or ‘off’, with ‘on’ denoting  activation of the feature.

1.	Metronome (Met): The metronome produces a steady beat to help users play rhythms accurately on the synthesizer. A speed parameter providing 8 levels of beats is controlled by a speed parameter, with 1 corresponding to the fastest beat and 8 corresponding to the slowest beat. The speed parameter is controlled by rotating knob 3.

2.	Fade: This function is used to hold a sound when pressed for some time and involves sustain time and fade speed. The sustain time determines how long the sound will remain after a single pressing without release, and the fade speed determines how fast the sound will be gone after the sustain time has passed. The smaller the fade speed, the faster the sound will disappear. The sustain time can be set by rotating knob 3, with the fade speed changing between 1 and 2.

3.	Low frequency oscillator (LFO): This function adds a low frequency sine wave to the synthesized tone to make it sound more natural. It is controlled by a frequency parameter and a reduce LFO volume parameter. The frequency parameter dictates at which frequency the LFO will oscillate, essentially the frequency of the low frequency sound. It is controlled via rotation of knob 3. The LFO volume parameter controls the volume of the low frequency noise and is controlled by the rotation of knob 4.

4.	ADSR: This function modifies the amplitude of synthesized tone and involves an envelope consisting of three parameters: attack, decay, and sustain. The attack parameter determines how fast the sound will reach its peak amplitude value. The decay parameter allows controlling by how much the amplitude of the sound will decrease. The sustain parameter tells for how long the sound will remain. The three parameters are set via rotation of knobs 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

5.	Low pass filter (LPF): The low pass filter is used to remove high frequency components in the synthesized tone to make it sound smoother. The cutoff frequency of the low pass filter is set by the frequency parameter (Fre), with a maximum value of 2000Hz and a minimum value of 500Hz and is set by the rotation of knob 3.
